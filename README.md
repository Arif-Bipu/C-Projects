# Overview
This repository will be a culmination of all of my projects completed in C. These projects will involve creating applications, smartarrays, and any other projects I find an interest in.


## Projects Currently Completed
- **Fibonacci** - Involves developing a fibonnaci function that avoids repetitive computation by computing the sequence linearly from the bottom up, F(0) to F(n). 
- **Varg** - Involves writing variadic functions that take a variable number of arguments and their functional prototypes. 
- **Kindred Spirits** -  Involves developing a program working with recursive binary trees to see if binary trees are "kindred spirits" of each other, meaning the preorder traversal of one is the correspondent of the postorder traversal of the other tree.
- **SmartArray** - Involves the implementation of smart arrays, arrays that expand automatically when they get too full. The smart array is designed to hold arrays of strings where it can automatically expand and add new elements in arbitrary postions or at the end of the smart array. 
- **TriePrediction** -  Involves using advanced tree data structure to create a trie data structure to store strings. The program involved inserting words from a corpus, implementing them in the Trienode and being able to output them back to the user.
